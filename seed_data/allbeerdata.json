As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty \u201849ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn\u2019t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA\u2122.\r\n\r\nAnchor IPA\u2122 is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.\r\n\r\nThe elephant you see on Anchor IPA\u2122 was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To \"see the elephant\" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nThere once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. \"I don\u2019t give a hoot,\" exclaimed the farmer. \"I have seen the elephant!\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives.

And, for this release, we chose three California ingredients\u2014lemongrass, lemon peel, and ginger\u2014whose synergy adds a tangy crispness and herbal spiciness to this sharply refreshing, uniquely Californian saison.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 and the Southern Pacific\u2019s \u201cSunset Route\u201d in 1883, coupled with the advent of refrigerated railcars, made it possible for California brewers and farmers to ship their products out of state.

Automatic is a modern pale ale with an ABV of 5.2-\u00ad\u2010percent that features a prominent hop flavor and aroma.

A mix of Mosaic and Crystal hops are used to create a delicate balance and give the beer an aroma that features a complex array of berry, citrus, herbal and pine notes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAutomatic is meant to be light, refreshing and quite drinkable without falling into the common pitfall of ending up too thin, watery or insipid. No color malts were used, however, the relatively full mouthfeel is enough to support this heavily hopped beer,\u201d says Co-\u00adFounder and Brewmaster Adam Beauchamp. \u201cThe flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more earthiness and stone fruit, leading to a nicely balanced and moderately bitter finish.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce again, we collaborated with a local artist to design the can label.

In May 2006 the Baltika #3 was produced in an innovative package: a premium 1 liter PET-package that looks practically the same as the half-liter glass bottle. In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market. In April 2008 a 1.5-liter PET bottle with a \"football\" design was produced for the Baltika #3, especially for the Russian Football Championship. The PET-glass material has high protective qualities and keeps the most popular Russian beer fresh for a longer period.\r\n\r\nDue to the high demand the production of this popular brand keeps growing. By the results of the 2008, the volume of sales amounted +7,5% (Business Analytica) , which allows the brand to remain a certain leader in the medium-price segment. The highest distribution level of Baltika Company for food products (98%) makes the Baltika \u21163 available for buyers all over the country.\r\n\r\nToday the Classic beer is exported to over 40 countries around the world, including Germany, Japan, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, France, and Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor ten years running the Baltika #3 Classic has received the prestigious Russian \"Commodity of the Year\" prize in the field of consumer goods. The prize is awarded to the most popular mass consumption products available in the assortment of retail shops. Since the time the prize was established the Baltika #3 Classic has been the unconditional leader in the \"beer\" category.\r\n\r\nThis beer brand is also annually declared \"The Most People\u2019s Brand\" by the results of tasting at the Moscow Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in Russia. In 2008 the Baltika #3 won a silver medal at the Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels established by the International Taste and Quality Institute.

For generations, this dessert has combined the sweetness of figs with the earthy spice of a graham cracker crust. Patrick, Tim, and Gopal decided to reproduce this classic flavor profile in Black Mission by combining a beer style that has a toasty, bread-like quality with a yeast strain that has fruity esters.\r\n \r\nTo create this distinct dichotomy of flavors, Black Mission utilizes aged hops that are traditionally found in Belgian Tripels along with a grain bill reminiscent of a Vienna lager. The fruity and spicy traits of a Belgian Tripel complement the toasty, graham cracker flavors of the malt.

When it comes to grain, just name it, barley, oats, wheat, rye and corn. The rye malt and oats produce a really earthy smell in the mash. For this ale we use a specific saison ale strain. This yeast has been cultured to produce a lot of fruity and spicy esters, such as apricot, clove, banana and anise. Keeping the a fermentation temperature at 68 degrees controls the ester of the yeast strain. This yeast strain also likes to take its\u2019 time, a long and slow fermentation settles out the finished beer. This is a good sippin\u2019 beer for me. I enjoy a glass when all the work of the day is done. The complexity of this beer re-energizes me.\r\n\r\nThis is a great seasonal beer that we released in the spring the last two years.

The combination of these two seasonal ingredients \u2013 we waited until the cucumbers were ready here in Northern Colorado \u2013 creates a wonderfully crisp aroma combination. Light flavorful cucumber characteristics are complemented by the clear basil notes both present in the effervescent body of the beer. Overall a refreshing twist on the traditional Ko\u0308lsch style that makes a wonderful summertime beer."}, {"website": null, "name": "Curious IPA", "style_id": 30, "labels": null, "beer_variation": null, "beer_variation_id": null, "name_display": "Curious IPA", "abv": "5.6", "year": null, "beer_id": "1pwxBs", "ibu": null, "description": "Curious IPA is a powerfully hoppy India Pale Ale brewed using the finest pale ale malt and three complementary hops.

To satisfy the appetite of Game of Thrones fans, production of Take the Black Stout will more than double the final volumes of Iron Throne Blonde Ale. \r\n\r\nInspired by the brotherhood of the Night\u2019s Watch, Take the Black Stout was made to be deep, dark and complex like those who have sworn the oath to defend Westeros against threats from the north. The label depicts the Weirwood tree where Jon Snow recited the oath before joining the Night\u2019s Watch. \r\n\r\nThe beer pours black with a good amount of tan head (though the kegs were pouring a bit foamy). Aroma has a rich chocolate malt with a good amount of red fruit. The mouthfeel has an average carbonation with a medium body. The flavor starts on a rich red fruit flavor, reminiscent of plum, that moves to a roasty malt with hints of chocolate and molasses that finishes on a subtle licorice bite. The aftertaste has a slightly dry, chalky mouthfeel possessing a lingering licorice flavor with a slight bitterness. As you drink it a slight warming develops in the back of the palate\r\n\r\nIn time for the holidays, Take the Black Stout makes for the perfect gift.

Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is very simple and basic with an emphasis on the variety of hops we select each year. Lately, we have selected Centennial and Chinook hops for our High Tide IPA. We used Centennial at the end of the boil and Chinook for the Dry Hopping.

These notes also come through in the flavor along with chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, bourbon soaked oak, and a sweet but spicy finish, with minor supporting hints of the familiar smokey camp fire coming through.  Despite its deep black color with mahogany highlights, this is one truly quaffable ale.  Perfect on its own, or a great match up with any of our wood grilled offerings or one of our delicious homemade desserts like the bread pudding or brownies and ice cream."}, {"website": null, "name": "Palo Santo Marron", "style_id": 37, "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7LrYr1/upload_9kjIcO-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7LrYr1/upload_9kjIcO-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7LrYr1/upload_9kjIcO-icon.png"}, "beer_variation": null, "beer_variation_id": null, "name_display": "Palo Santo Marron", "abv": "12", "year": null, "beer_id": "7LrYr1", "ibu": "50", "description": "An unfiltered, unfettered, unprecedented brown ale aged in handmade wooden brewing vessels.

Utilizing a grape that most often makes up smaller percentages of wine blends in France, we extract massive leathery notes, hints of tobacco, heavy beats of beets, delicate tannins, jammy notes of raspberries and boysenberries, and then finally a very effervescent cranberry-like finish.

Our friend Thomas at Weyermann Malts in Bamberg, Germany custom-designed the malt profile for this recipe (over breakfast no less!), and we brewed it in tribute to our close ties with them.\r\nHISTORY & STYLE\r\n\r\nRauchbier is a beer style originating in the region of Franconia in Germany. The unique feature of this style is that the malt has been kilned over wood fire (typically beechwood).

The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short\u2019s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD\u2019s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade.

We have stayed true to our original goal of making straight ahead strong ales and letting them rest in wood barrels to mature and develop flavors slowly and naturally.  We again met with some of the area\u2019s best wine makers and allowed them to guide us to the finished product.  Most of the beers that are in this blend are old friends who we know well.  Dark and ominous Parabola along with the rich and complex Bravo Brown were brewed again this year and together became the center piece of this blend.  Other beers like the Rufus and Opal along with Sean Paxton\u2019s Saucerful of Secrets are still tucked away in the cellar in their original first generation form, gaining character with extended aging.   Velvet Merkin has established itself as a real barrel loving beer, although it is only 6%, it carries barrel qualities beautifully.  A new beer, that was created this year by our Cellar Master Ali Razi, is Double Double Barrel Ale and it found its way into this blend as well.  In the end, this year brought us seven wine makers and seven beers to counter balance our lucky thirteenth year of brewing beer on the Central Coast.
